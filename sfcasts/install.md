# API Platform Installation!

Yo friends! It's time to talk about... drum roll... how to bake a delicious cake
that looks like an Oreo. Wait... huh? Wrong tutorial. It's time to talk about
API Platform! And I am *so* excited... like *almost* as excited as if I were eating
a giant cake that looks like an Oreo.

API Platform is *crushing* it these days - everywhere I turn, someone is *raving*
about it! Its lead developer - KÃ©vin Dunglas - is a core contributor of Symfony,
*super* nice guy and absolutely pushing the boundaries of what API's can do. You
will see that first-hand. He was also nice enough to guide us on this tutorial!

## Modern APIs are Hard. API Platform is not

If you need to build a few API endpoints *just* to help with your JavaScript,
you might be thinking:

> What's the big deal? Returning some JSON here and there is already pretty easy!

Little-by-little, I think this way of thinking is becoming less and less true.
*Just* like how frameworks were born when web applications became more and more
complex, tools like API Platform have been created because the same things is
happening to APIs.

These days, API's are more than just returning JSON: it's about being able to
serialize and deserialize your models, maybe into multiple formats, like JSON or XML,
but also JSON-LD or HAL JSON. Then there's hypermedia, linked data, status codes,
error formats, documentation - including OpenAPI spec documentation that can power
Swagger. Then there's security, CORS, access control and other important features
like pagination, filtering, validation, content-type negotiation, GraphQL... and
I could keep going.

*This* is why API Platform exists: to allow us to build a *killer* API and *love*
doing it! Oh, and all that stuff I just listed that an API needs? API Platform
comes with *all* of that. And it's not just for building a *huge* API. It's the
perfect tool even if you only need a few endpoints to power your own JavaScript.

## API Platform Distribution

So let's do this! API Platform is an independent PHP library that's built on top
of the Symfony components. You don't *need* to use it from inside a Symfony app,
but as you can see here that's how they recommend using it, which is great for us.

If you follow their documentation, they have their *own* API Platform *distribution*:
a custom directory structure with a *bunch* of stuff: one directory for your API,
another for your JavaScript frontend, *another* for an admin frontend *all*
wired together with Docker! Woh! It's a bit of a "big" thing to start with, but
you get all of the features out-of-the-box. If that speaks to you, you can totally
use that.

But we will do something different: we're going to install API Platform as a bundle
into a normal, traditional Symfony app. It makes learning API Platform a bit easier.
Once you're confident, for your project, you can do it this way *or* jump in and
use the official distribution.

## Project Setup

Anyways, to become the API hero that we all need, you should *totally* code along
with me by downloading the course code from this page. After you unzip it, you'll
find a `start/` directory inside with that same code you see here... which is
*actually* just a new Symfony 4.2 skeleton project: there is *nothing* special
installed or configured yet. Follow the `README.md` file for the setup instructions.

The *last* step will be to open a terminal, move into the project and start the
Symfony server with:

```terminal
symfony serve -d
```

This uses the `symfony` executable - an awesome little dev tool that you can
download at https://symfony.com/download. This starts a web server on port 8000
that runs in the background. Which means that *we* can find our browser, head to
`localhost:8000` and see... well, basically nothing! Just the nice welcome page
you see in an empty Symfony app.

## Installing API Platform

Now that we have an empty Symfony project, how can we install API Platform? Oh,
it's so awesome. Find your terminal and run:

```terminal
composer require api
```

That's it. You'll notice that this is installing something called the
`api-platform/api-pack`. If you remember from our Symfony series, a "pack" is sort
of a "fake" library that helps to install several thing at once.

Heck, you can see this at `https://github.com/api-platform/api-pack`: it's a single
`composer.json` file that requires several libraries, like Doctrine, a CORS
bundle that we'll talk about later, annotations, API Platform itself and a few
parts of Symfony, like the validation system, security component and even twig,
which is used to generate some really cool documentation that we'll see in a minute.

But, there's nothing *that* interesting yet: just API Platform and some standard
Symfony packages.

Back in the terminal, it's done and some details on how to get started. We'll
go through these steps in a minute. But before we do *anything* else, we can already
go back to the browser and head to `https://localhost:8000/api`... to see woh!
We have API documentation! Well, we don't *have* any API yet... so there's nothing
here. But this is going to be a *huge*, free feature you get with API Platform:
as we build our API, this page will automatically update.

Let's see that next by creating an *exposing* our first API Resource.
